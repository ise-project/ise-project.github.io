<li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping track of daily routines such as eating lunch, doing chores and going to bed at a certain time may seem like simple tasks, for someone with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that may not be the case. The symptoms for someone diagnosed with ASD may vary but common things is issues with executive functions especially with the working memory and being able to shift attention from one activity to another. (Russo et al., 2007). This becomes an issue for people with autism since our daily lives are filled with activities and challenges, and activities often shifts from one to another in many areas such as our home, school or workplace. An activity change can mean a uncertainty about what is happening next or that a learned routine is interrupted. (Flannery &amp; Horner,1994; Mesibov, Shea, &amp; Schopler, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persons diagnosed with ASD is in need of clear and concrete instructions to avoid ambiguity. If only verbal instructions are given about ending an activity while different options about the next activity is presented, someone with ASD may have a hard time interpreting this information which can result in a feeling of reduced control followed by anxiety (Steingard et. al, 1997). To ease activity changes, transition strategies can create clarity and support change if the strategies are conducted prior, during and after an activity change with the purpose of creating a positive routine for activity changes using verbal and visual support (Simpson, Myles, &amp; Ganz, 2000; Schmit, Alper, Raschke, &amp; Ryndak, 2000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habiliteringen is a company that offers efforts to makes the daily life more functioning for someone with varying disabilities. Habiliteringen is the contact(orderer) of the project, and the target group is child and youth rehabilitation in V&auml;sterbottens L&auml;ns Landsting (VLL) where the most of them have the diagnose ASD. This group usually lives with their parents or family homes. Daily routines and eating habits varies, this group tend to spend a lot of time using a screen and needs help with ending and starting a new activity. The group does not feel isolated or experience any social alienation, however, their parents want them to spend more time with friends. The intention of this project is to create helpful discrete tools that can be used by someone diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder for such activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>AIM AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim of the project is to prepare, support and guide adolescents with autism with daily activities. The goal is to help them preparing the end, actually ending and start a new activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key questions the group faces is how to motivate and make the youths understand the necessity of the actual activity, without punishment or stress. How to encourage and motivate someone to do a task? Also without making it just a traditional calendar, make a plan for the day or week. How to do so without stressing them out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with ASD are in need of clear direction. How to make the tasks as clear and obvious as possible for everyone to understand what is needed to be done? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An other challenge is the activity transitions, how is it possible to make the transitions as smooth as possible for everyone?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>METHODS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design process that we are going to use is divided in five steps. The first step is to define the problem, to see what the problem is and how it appears. The second step is to collect information about the problem. For the first and second step, we are going to collaborate with the occupational therapy students to get the information we need to proceed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brainstorming an idea from the input from the occupational therapy students is the third step in the process. The fourth step is to develop the prototype based on the best idea. In the last step of the process, the prototype is tested on the occupational therapy students since we do not have access to the real target group. This process will be iterative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not meet the stakeholders of the project because they are in another city.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Scenario </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use scenarios we are considering to analyze are mostly narrowed down to direct interactions between the user and a software agent, a smartphone application. This smartphone application presents the user with a schedule and the rest of the environment should try to ensure he remains on schedule in a motivational way. In order to do this, we are planning to design a reward system. Then, when a sufficient amount of points is reached, the parents have the responsibility to reward him (go to the movies, choose the dinner on Friday night, some computer time, candies, &hellip;). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key problems of these persons is that they often need clear instructions to realize something considered simple (cooking a meal or showering for example). The application for each activity should provide with clearly detailed instructions to help them understand why they need to do the activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persona</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made personas from the information we received from the OT-students. Below you can read about a persona we made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karl Englund is a 17 year old, computer loving student and lives with the cognitive disability autism which makes it easy for him to get stuck in activities. This makes him struggling to do the daily needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 2. Environment Model</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anticipated Design Solution that will be Demonstrated January 10-11</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are planning to design a prototype consisting of a simple smartphone application with another NFC device, which in real life should be placed in the kitchen or bathroom. Scanning the NFC will reward the user with points and might add some fun to the related activity. We will also demonstrate some possible functions that can extend the use of the app such as a smart bottle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 3. Decision tree to remind the user to drink while using a computer</span></p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="images/decisiontree.jpg" alt="Decision Tree">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This example shows an adaptive behaviour of the system by choosing which media and device to send a reminder to. The bottle changes color at the normal time the user should drink at. If he does not react, the system will try different ways of notifying him. In the long run, the system can choose which kind of media the user reacts to better depending on his situation and personal preferences (using the computer or not). The system can also by default take in account that the user has some physical disabilities (hearing, sight).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social norms help building the daily schedule of the user, which comes from a manual input from the parents. The user rewards should be tailored to motivate the user do the activities that are the most necessary and the user is less motivated to do. The 20 minutes limit behind schedule has been set by the OT students, and the user is rewarded differently depending on his reaction time, on how far he actually is from his schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sufficient data, it could be possible to adjust the number of points granted by the activities they seem to enjoy doing less in order to motivate them better to work on the areas where they tend to lack. However, this might lead them to forget the activities they previously learned by focusing too much on the activities they have not learned yet. A sufficient amount of exterior management is still needed and some thresholds should be defined to manage the balance of the whole system. The family could also access statistics to help them understand how they may help more efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also interesting to look further on activity </span><strong>switch</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> patterns that seem to be more difficult for the user. Is switching from playing a videogame to eating more difficult than switching from exercising? Then this first activity switch should be worth more points. The system could then adapt itself on the long run by tracking which activities switch patterns are the most difficult, depending on the time the user takes to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point is to maintain the regularity of the user in doing the activities.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requirements</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notifications should be progressive (steps of 5 min) and not exceed a time limit of 20 minutes compared to the planned schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system developed should look reassuring, using a color scheme. Each day should have its own color, and each activity should be distinguishable by a symbol or picture and a short text label. &nbsp;The reward system should not be punishing (minus points) and not too linear as this might make the user bored out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user&rsquo;s parents should also be able to feed important data, mainly an activity schedule, through the same application. If the user takes too much time to realize one activity, the systems should proactively warn the parents, providing information about the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should present some accessibility functions, for example reading out loud an activity on the calendar.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphone with NFC. The NFC is used to identify the user when he moves to specific rooms (kitchen, bathroom). RFID could not be used because the user might trigger unwanted readers without actually being in the room. We want the user to choose to trigger it by choice. It s not possible to use simpler motion sensors or pressure tiles because he lives with his family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFC scanners </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart bottle:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamp that change color depending on how long ago the user drank from the bottle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green light when it's time for the user to drink.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight sensor. Measuring how much is left in the bottle and how much the user has been drinking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluetooth. Bluetooth is used to exchange information between the bottle and the app on the smartphone.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>TIME PLAN</strong></li>
</ol>
<img class="img-fluid" src="images/timeplan.png" alt="Time Plan">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blue lines are the time we should finish the different tasks. The red dots are the deadlines we have on the schedule. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project should consider ethical issues, such as the privacy and safety of the user group. It is not possible to monitor the user actually doing the activity because the goal is to make him learn how to do it by himself &nbsp;through guidance instead of surveillance. For instance, using a camera and image recognition in the bathroom to monitor that he is showering can be fearful for the user and prevent him from doing the task. This is especially an issue today with all the recent Internet of Things security flaws. The Mirai botnet that exploits public CCTV surveillance cameras and the website Insecam raised a lot of awareness about this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance should not be too heavy either, as the project needs to have some lasting cognitive impact on the user. With time, he should be able to do the different activities with less and less guidance. But he still has the choice to access back to this guidance if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing with the targeted user group will not be possible as they live in another city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>EXPECTED RESULTS AND/OR DISCUSSION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the project we expect to have a prototype for an app with the aim to be a helpful tool for someone diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The app's purpose is to help its users with daily activities, focusing on helping them with the preparation of ending, actually ending and starting a new activity.</span></p>
